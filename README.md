The provided code contains two fetch request functions: getPeople and getPersonInfo. These functions are responsible for fetching data from the Star Wars API (SWAPI) using the fetch API in JavaScript.

getPeople Function
This function retrieves a list of people (characters) from the SWAPI. It makes an asynchronous GET request to the /people/ endpoint of the SWAPI. The function waits for 300 milliseconds before making the request to simulate a delay. If the request is successful (status code 200), it returns the response as a Promise with the type ApiResponse<Person[]>, where Person is a type representing a single character. If there is an HTTP error (status code other than 200), it throws an error with the HTTP status.

getPersonInfo Function
This function retrieves detailed information about a specific person (character) based on their userId. It makes an asynchronous GET request to the /people/{userId}/ endpoint of the SWAPI, where {userId} is the ID of the person. Similar to getPeople, it waits for 300 milliseconds before making the request. If the request is successful, it returns the response as a Promise with the type Person. If there is an HTTP error, it throws an error with the HTTP status.

Both functions utilize the get function, which is a generic function for making GET requests. It constructs the full URL by appending the provided url to the BASE_URL of the SWAPI. If the response is not okay, it throws an error with the corresponding HTTP status.

These functions provide a convenient way to interact with the SWAPI and retrieve data about Star Wars characters.
